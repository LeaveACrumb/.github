# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs is a social platform that blends real-time location sharing -- similar to Find My iPhone -- with the messaging, photo, and music-sharing features of traditional social apps like Instagram and Facebook. By capturing spatiotemporal data, Breadcrumbs allows users to share not only where they are, but where they’ve been: a living 24-hour trail made up of photos, songs, posts, and pins that reflect their day. Users can interact with friends by comparing music and location histories, pictures, and direct messages.

Designed around meaningful connection rather than public performance, Breadcrumbs encourages users to connect only with close friends and family. We will not encourage pressure to build a large following -- just a private, dynamic space to stay present in each other’s lives, whether nearby or far away. Breadcrumbs will have a notion of a profile too with stats like a best friend (person you've been around the most) or favorite song, your most played song for the week. We hope that we can build an online environment that encourages safety, awareness, and fun for friends and families around the world.
